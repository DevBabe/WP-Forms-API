# WP_Forms_API

A Drupal-esque API for creating and processing forms in WordPress

Provides a 'WP_Forms_API' class composed of static methods which can be used
to render forms defined by arbitrary data structures. You can also process the results
submitted in those forms into a coherent set of values, smoothing over data types,
validation (TODO: not yet!!) and allowing for function integration into WordPress.

## Why?

Writing and managing admin forms in WordPress is a real pain in the butt, and a
data-driven approach is much more flexible and Drupal-y. WordPress tends to
implement forms and other complex markup structures with literal markup
templates, but those can be very difficult to manage and update. I have not
seen any other similar development projects that brings some of the best ideas
from Drupal into WordPress where they can benefit developers and clients alike
by providing rapid development tools.

Having forms driven by data sets instead of templates and markup creates a very generic,
predictable, and stylizable structure in the rendered form markup, and easy managements
and updates to the form structure.

## Overview

There are two basic elements:

'form', which is any associative array.

'element', which is any associative array having at least `#type` and `#key` keys.

## Quick Start

```php
/**
 * Define a form called 'my-form' which contains an address1 and address2
 * input, and another form called 'citystatezip' which contains three input
 * elements: city, state, zipcode
 */
$form = array(
  '#id' => 'my-form',

  'address1' => array(
    '#label' => "Street",
    '#type' => 'text',
    '#placeholder' => "Line 1",
  ),
  'address2' => array(
    '#type' => 'text',
    '#placeholder' => "Line 2"
  ),

  'citystatezip' => array(
    'city' => array(
      '#type' => 'text',
      '#label' => "City",
      '#placeholder' => "Boston",
      '#size' => 20
    ),
    'state' => array(
      '#type' => 'text',
      '#label' => "State",
      '#placeholder' => "MA",
      '#size' => 4,
    ),
    'zipcode' => array(
      '#type' => 'text',
      '#label' => "ZIP",
      '#placeholder' => "01011",
      '#size' => 7
    )
  ),
);

/**
 * Define the values for this form
 */
$values = array(
  'city' => "Omaha",
  'state' => "Nebraska"
);

/**
 * You can render the form in whatever context you'd like: Front-end, meta boxes,
 * wherever. Does not containing <form> elements: the form is expected to be
 * defined at this point.
 */

WP_Forms_API::render_form( $form, $values );

/**
 * Now I want to save the elements from this form. Each element gets an input
 * with the same name as its '#key' which defaults to its array key.
 */
add_action( 'save_post', function( $post ) use ( $form ) {
  $post = get_post( $post );

  // Fill in posted values for this form in $values. Every key
  // in $values is guaranteed to be defined for every input in defined in $form.
  WP_Forms_API::process_form( $form, $values );

  update_post_meta( $post->ID, 'city', $values['city'] );
} )
```

## Reference

Forms and elements are represented with simple associative arrays.

A form is a top-level object, but an element is also a form.

Special keys start with '#', all other keys are interpreted as elements in themselves.

Any form that contains a `#type` key is considered to be an input element and will
create a corresponding named form input.

### Functions

This plugin implements a class `WP_Forms_API` which provides the following static methods:


#### `WP_Forms_API::render_form( $form, &$values, $top = null )`

Render a form with values. This is the primary rendering function you'll need.

`$form` - (array) - The form to render.

`$values` - (array ref) - The values for the elements in this form. While the form structure is nested and heirarchical, the values structure is flat (mostly: see 'composite' values).

`$top` - (optional array) - The top-level form.


#### `WP_Forms_API::render_element( $element, $values, $form = null )` - Render a single element

Renders an element, emitting the appropriate markup.

Applies 'wp_form_element_{$form_id}-{$element_key}' filter to element before rendering.


#### `WP_Forms_API::make_tag( $tagname, $attrs, $content = null )

Render and emit single HTML tag.

`$tagname` - (string) - The name of the HTML tag to emit. If empty, do nothing.

`$attrs` - (array) - An associative array of HTML attributes for this tag.

`$content` - (string|false) - The content for this tag, if any. If null, then emit a self-closing tag. If `false`, then the tag will not be closed.


#### `WP_Forms_API::get_elements( $form )` - Initialize and return all of the elements of a form.

`$form` - (array) The form to extract elements from.

Use this function to get initialized sub-elements from a form, and skip all the special keys.

### Forms

All keys in forms are optional.

*  `#id` (string) The reference ID for this form, for filtering output. When defined, elements are run through the filter `wp_form_element_{$form_id}-{$element_key}` before they are rendered, so they can be modified, removed, or otherwise.

*  `#label` (string) The label for this form or element.

*  `#class` (array) CSS classes in `class` attributes.

*  `#attrs` The attributes to use for the rendered container tag. If `class` key is specified, is it prepended by the classes in `#class`.

*  `#container` (string)

The tag name for the container of this form or element. Defaults to `div`.

*  `#container_classes` (array)

An array of CSS classes to add to the container element.

### Elements

An element is an associative array with at least a '#type' key. An element
can have any of the properties of a form, as well as the following:

*  `#type` (string)

When present, indicates that the element is an input element. Special values:

Values:
* `'text'` â€“ Plain text input.
* `'select'` - A select box. Requires `#options` key.
* `'checkbox'` - A boolean.
* `'textarea'` - A textarea.
* `'multiple'` - A collection of values.
* `'composite'` - A composite value which is posted as an array in #key.
* Any other value will be rendered as a text input. You can use custom types along with the '`wp_form_element_{$form_id}_{$key}` filter to define input tag types 

*  `#key` (string)

The key for this element. Is used to create default form element `name`
attributes and slugs for classes.

*  `#placeholder` (string)

The placeholder to use in the form element. Applies to 'text' and 'textarea' types.

*  `#options` (array)

The options, as given by 'value' => "Label", for this input element. Only applies to select.

*  `#required` (bool)

Whether or not the key is required. (TODO: Currently only affects `'select'`-type elements.)

*  `#name` (string, optional)

The input element name - defaults to `#key`.

*  `#slug` (string, optional)

The CSS element name - defaults to `#key`.

*  `#size` (int)

The size of the element.

*  `#multiple` (array)

Required for `$form['#type'] == 'multiple'`. Define another form whose values are collected into an array for this element.

*  `#add_link` (string)

When using #multiple, the text to show for the "Add Item" button.

*  `#remove_link` (string)

When using #multiple, the text to show for the "Remove Item" button.

*  `#content` (string)

Any content to put in the input tag. Additional content from rendering the tag will be appended to this value if it is provided.

*  `#tag` (string)

The actual tag name to use for the input. Should be changed using `wp_form_element_{$form['#id']}_{$element['#key']}` filter.
## CSS

The API renders forms with a breadcrumb of sorts in the CSS class name.

Forms get the following classes: `.wp-form`, and if #id is defined, `.wp-form-{$form['#id']}`
Each element is rendered in a container element of tag `#container` with classes defined in `#container_classes` plus the following: `wp-form-field wp-form-element`.

Each input element is rendered using the tag $element['#tag'] and attributes in $element['#attrs']. These values can be modified per-element using the `wp_form_element_{$form['#id']}_{$element['#key']}` filters. The default classes are `.wp-form-input`, `.wp-form-input-{$element['#slug']}`.

Labels receive the class `.wp-form-label`.
